## What is NeMo Framework?

[NeMo Framework](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/) is NVIDIA‚Äôs GPU-accelerated, end-to-end training platform for large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and speech models. It enables seamless scaling of both pretraining and post-training workloads, from a single GPU to clusters with thousands of nodes, supporting Hugging Face/PyTorch and Megatron models. NeMo includes a suite of libraries and curated training recipes to help users build models from start to finish.
